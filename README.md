I noticed performance issues in the program edit page, which reminded me that I still need to implement a context management system. After looking at the options, I decided that the best solution was to build custom hooks to handle user context and any other key data.

This strikes a nice balance between technical debt (current implementation) and overly complex systems (redux). Once I scale up to the beta, I'll build a more robust context management solution.

(future)

RIP

I'm gonna say goodbye to this version. I learned a lot about building forms and basic pages, but it's rife with inefficient code and underlying flaws (no user auth).

I'm going to cut my losses and move on, as I feel that it would take more time to refactor everything to my current knowledge than to simply start fresh.

The select components are pretty sweet tho, I'll keep them around in next version.

Rest In Peace v0.4

(btw, the api key in the commit history doesn't work anymore :P)

# To test:

0. go to a new directory and run 'git clone https://github.com/d00mkeeps/trainsmart'
1. look up 'supabase'
2. make an account on the first legitimate looking website (it'll have a green logo)
3. create a file named '.env.local' in the root directory (should be named 'trainsmart')
4. put your secret keys in the .env.local and name them properly
5. guess my DB schema and test the app!
